            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>There have been 12 British monarchs since the political union of the Kingdom of England and the Kingdom of Scotland on 1 May 1707. England and Scotland had been in personal union since 24 March 1603. On 1 January 1801, the Kingdom of Great Britain and the Kingdom of Ireland merged, which resulted in the creation of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. After 26 of Ireland's 32 counties left the union on 6 December 1922, in order to form the Irish Free State, the name of the nation was amended to the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland on 12 April 1927.</p>
